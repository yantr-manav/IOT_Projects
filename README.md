## ðŸ§  Working Principle

- **Bluetooth Serial** communication is established using `BluetoothSerial.h`.
- Commands received over Bluetooth are parsed using `BT.read()` and trigger movement functions.
- `analogWrite()` sets the motor speed through EN pins.
- Each motor is controlled independently for precise direction control.

## ðŸ›  Setup Instructions

1. Connect the ESP32 to the motor drivers according to the pin configuration table.
2. Power the ESP32 and motor drivers using a suitable battery (7.4V or 12V).
3. Upload the code to your ESP32 via the Arduino IDE.
4. Open a Bluetooth terminal app and pair with **ESP32_RC_Car**.
5. Send commands (`F`, `B`, `L`, `R`, `S`) and the robot will respond accordingly.
